This web app shows an Atom (RSS) feed of the top rated Hacker News articles
from the past week. It is hosted on Heroku [here][1]. I wrote it in Ruby on
Rails because I'm lazy, its overkill for this, but hey, who cares?

I created Hacker News Weekly because I found myself checking Hacker News
constantly, afraid to miss any tidbit of nerd awesomeness and using HN
to fill moments that I'd rather fill with something more satisfying. On the
other hand, I would like to stay current on the HN memes and new tech
goodness going down, but I only need the top stuff.

My new diet consists of the top 10 HN articles of the past week, delivered once
a week, every Sunday morning, through this app and [r2e][2], a tool that checks
for updated RSS feeds and emails them out. Oh, and [leechblock][3], to keep me
honest. :)
